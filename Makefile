# devbrain — `make help` lists targets. The whole suite is Go now:
# `make test` == `go test ./...` (unit, golden, and CLI black-box tests that
# build the binary and drive it as a subprocess via internal/clitest), wrapped by
# scripts/test-guard.sh so a test that escapes its tempdir can't corrupt this repo.
