# devbrain — published-tarball clean-room install test.
#
# Every OTHER install test runs scripts/install.sh from the repo CHECKOUT, which
# contains every file — so a runtime reference to a file the npm package does NOT
# ship (e.g. anything dropped by a `!scripts/...` rule in package.json `files`)
# passes the suite yet breaks a real `npx getdevbrain install`. This test closes
# that gap: it builds the ACTUAL tarball with `npm pack`, extracts it, and installs
# FROM THE EXTRACTED PACKAGE into a throwaway $HOME — exactly what npx unpacks and
# runs. A missing runtime file makes install.sh abort under `set -euo pipefail`,
# failing here instead of in a user's terminal.
#
# Hermetic: `--without flusher,git-gate` keeps it off the OS user's crontab/systemd
# and out of any parent git repo; DEVBRAIN_NO_PATH/NO_IMPORT keep it from editing
# rc files or scanning real history; everything writes under a temp HOME. No network
# (npm pack is local). Skips cleanly if npm or python3 is absent.
